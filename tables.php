    <h1>Relational Databases</h1>
    <p>Relational databases model data by storing rows and columns in tables. The power of the
        relational database lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables
        and in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationships between those
        tables involved in the query.
    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Database - contains many tables</li>
        <li>relation (or table) - contains tuples and attributes</li>
        <li>Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represent an "object" 
            like a person or a music track</li>
        <li>Attribute (also a column or field) - one of possibly many elements of data corresponding
            to the object represented by the row</li>
    </ul>
